GEM_ADVE_v8a,GEM_ADVE_v9,"The v8a does not utilize pathway in which the tetrahydromethanopterin (cpd00895, H4MPT) is involved. The H4MPT in v8a was a dead-end metabolite which is neither produced nor imported. Therefore, 7,8-dihydromethanopterin (cpd03523, H2MPT) was first added and a reaction of H4MPT production from H2MPT was added. H2MPT is expected to be imported from the medium (referred to OB3b model from Naizabekov and Lee, 2020). The v8a have a reaction that converts methylene-H4MPT to methenyl-H4MPT (rxn03079) and it utilizes coenzyme-F420 which is not used in any other reactions in v8a. Therefore, rxn03079 was deleted, and two reactions (rxn37236 and rxn07848) that uses NAD or NADP were added. cpd03523 (7,8-dihydromethanopterin, H2MPT) added to both cytosol and extracellular, which created exchange reactions of cpd03523 automatically. For model to produce H4MPT from H2MPT, a reaction rxn02430 was added. The default reversibility was altered to be irreversible. rxn03079 removed since it utilizes coenzyme-F420 which is the required in any other reactions. In place of rxn03079, two reactions, rxn37236 and rxn07848, added that use either NAD or NADP. They are defined to be reversible in ModelSEED, however, the directions were altered to be irreversible.",KBase
